Midwest GameFest 2020 Raffle Drawing
This script reads data exported to CSV from TableTopEvents export of merchandise and imported into a google sheet.  https://tabletop.events/conventions/midwestgamefest2020/reports/merch-export
It then generates a list for random prize drawing of raffle prizes, and another function for picking the winners from that list.
